# The-Path
This is my person project by following tutorials and using code templates from http://teamtreehouse.com

"The Ox-herding pictures. In the tradition of Zen Buddhism, this series of ten images is used as an analogy for the stages of a practitioner's progression towards, and of, Enlightenment."
